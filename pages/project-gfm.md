# Ghost Fluid Method for Fluid–Solid Impact

High-level summary of a Ghost Fluid / multi-material approach for compressible flow with deformable solids.

## What I built / contributed
- Numerical method components for interface-consistent corrections within multi-stage RK time integration.
- Support for solid mechanics terms (e.g., deviatoric stress) in a coupled setting.
- Verification/validation style test cases and analysis workflows.

## Why it matters
Accurate interface treatment and stable coupling are critical for shock-driven fluid–solid interaction problems (e.g., impact, blast loading, cavitation-induced deformation).

## Status
This page is a living summary; I’m adding a public, reproducible mini-demo and write-up.
