# Shallow Water on the Sphere (Spectral)

Implementation notes and experiments on spectral methods for the shallow water equations on the sphere using spherical harmonics.

## What I built / explored
- Spectral representation using spherical harmonics for state variables.
- Time stepping and stability/accuracy comparisons.
- Validation against test cases (e.g., solid body rotation / standard benchmarks).

## Why it matters
Spectral methods can achieve high accuracy per degree of freedom for global atmospheric and geophysical flows, but require careful treatment of stability, dealiasing, and time stepping.

## Status
This page will be expanded with a small reproducible code and example outputs.
