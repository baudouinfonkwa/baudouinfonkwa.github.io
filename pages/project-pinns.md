# PINNs for Euler/Burgers with Adaptive Nets

Exploration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for PDEs with an emphasis on disciplined experimentation (baselines, ablations, and failure analysis).

## What I built / explored
- PINN baselines for 1D/2D test problems (e.g., Burgers, Euler variants).
- Adaptive architectures / curriculum-style training schedules to improve stability.
- Post-processing and evaluation scripts to compare against reference solutions.

## Why it matters
PINNs can work well in some regimes and fail badly in others; making progress requires careful measurement, controlled experiments, and an honest accounting of failure modes.

## Status
I’m consolidating this work into a small, reproducible repo with clear run commands and plots.
